# Royal Nordics Website Documentation

This document provides comprehensive information about the Royal Nordics website build process, structure, and functionality.

## Build Process

### Technology Stack

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core web technologies for structure, styling, and interactivity
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface
- **Webpack**: Module bundler for transpiling JSX and bundling JavaScript
- **Babel**: JavaScript compiler for converting JSX and modern JavaScript to browser-compatible code
- **HTTP-Server**: Simple local development server

### Build Configuration

The build process is configured in the following files:

1. **package.json**: Defines dependencies and scripts
   - `npm start`: Runs the HTTP server on the build directory
   - `npm run build`: Uses webpack to transpile and bundle the React code, then copies static files to the build directory

2. **webpack.config.js**: Configures webpack to:
   - Use Babel to transpile JSX and modern JavaScript
   - Bundle all JavaScript into a single file (bundle.js)
   - Set production mode for optimization

3. **render.yaml**: Configures the Render deployment
   - Specifies build and start commands
   - Defines routes and service type

### Build Process Flow

1. When `npm run build` is executed:
   - Webpack transpiles the React JSX code in script.js to browser-compatible JavaScript
   - The transpiled code is bundled into a single file (bundle.js)
   - The index.html and style.css files are copied to the build directory

2. When `npm start` is executed:
   - HTTP-Server serves the files from the build directory

3. When deployed to Render:
   - Render executes the build command (`npm run build`)
   - After successful build, Render starts the server using the start command (`npm start`)

## Website Structure

The Royal Nordics website consists of the following sections:

### Implementation Details

The website is implemented as a single-page application (SPA) using React:

- **index.html**: Contains the basic HTML structure and a root div for React to render into
- **script.js**: Contains the React components that render the website content
- **style.css**: Contains all the styling for the website

The React application in script.js renders all sections of the website within a single component. Navigation is implemented using anchor links that scroll to the appropriate section.
